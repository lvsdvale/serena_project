# Overview

**SERENA** â€“ *Smart Embedded Responsive Entity for Elderly Needs and Assistance* â€“ is our Healthcare Home Assistant: a comprehensive health monitoring and assistance solution, specially designed for elderly users and patients under continuous care.

### ðŸ§  The Problem

As populations age globally, the number of elderly individuals living with chronic conditions, cognitive decline, and visual impairments continues to grow. Many of these individuals struggle to manage their daily medication schedules, report symptoms accurately, and maintain consistent communication with healthcare providers â€” especially those living alone or in understaffed care environments. Missed doses, incorrect self-medication, and unreported health changes are common and can lead to serious complications or hospital readmissions.

### ðŸ’¡ Our Solution

SERENA addresses these challenges by integrating intelligent technology into a user-friendly, voice-interactive healthcare assistant. It ensures patients receive the correct medication at the right time, provides simple interfaces for symptom reporting, and keeps caregivers continuously informed through a secure cloud-based platform. By combining an embedded smart device with a centralized base station and a reliable communication infrastructure, SERENA promotes autonomy, safety, and proactive care.
